# Reflection â€“ Career Counselling

## STAR Reflection

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness Training, we were introduced to career counselling tools to help us understand potential career paths in IT.

**Task:**  
I had to identify career goals and reflect on how my academic progress aligns with the ICT industry.

**Action:**  
I engaged with the resources provided by the career office and completed a self-assessment quiz. I also attended a virtual session where we discussed roles like software developer, data analyst, and UX designer.

**Result:**  
I learned that I am most aligned with a role in front-end development due to my creativity and interest in UI/UX. I have begun exploring JavaScript and React more seriously. This session helped me narrow my focus and set clear goals.
